Apple's Keyboard Layout Data File
=================================

This repo contains some tools that decodes `AppleKeyboardLayouts-L.dat` file on macOS.

My Test Platform: macOS 12.6

Build & Run
-----------

Just open your terminal and change directory to this repo, type

    make all

and all generated files will be in `output` directory.

What Do I Get In The `output` Directory?
----------------------------------------

Maybe I will explain them after some extra work since I know too few about the
contents.

Special Thanks
--------------

When I started this project, this [repo](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Utilities/AppleKeyboardLayouts/AppleKeyboardLayouts.bt)
helps me to unarchive the origin file to save so much time knowing the file
structure.

Suggestions
-----------
